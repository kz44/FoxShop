In application.properties are used some environment variables:

`DB` for connection to database (the example of the value of this
variable: `jdbc:mysql://localhost/foxshop?serverTimezone=UTC`)

`DB_USERNAME` for username for connection to the database

`DB_PASSWORD` for the password.

You need to set up these environment variables.
